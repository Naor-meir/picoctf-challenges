# PicoCTF Writeups

Welcome to my PicoCTF challenge writeups repository.  
This project documents my personal journey through the world of Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, with a focus on solving and learning from challenges in **PicoCTF** – a beginner-friendly CTF created by security experts at Carnegie Mellon University.

## 📁 Categories Covered

The writeups are organized by challenge category:

- 🔐 `cryptography` – Classic and modern cryptographic challenges.
- 🌐 `web_exploitation` – Common web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, etc.).
- 🧠 `reverse_engineering` – Analyzing binaries and understanding compiled code.
- 🕵️ `forensics` – Analyzing files, packets, and memory dumps.
- ⚙️ `binary_exploitation` – Stack overflows, memory corruption, and more.
- 🛠️ `general_skills` – Foundational skills (encoding, Linux, scripting).
- 🤖 `pwn` – Low-level memory and shell challenges.
